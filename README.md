## Getting Started
To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "Zoner.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `Zoner.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```

I HATE Rojo. Everything is so ugly and it turned my organization into an abomination of folders and init files.
